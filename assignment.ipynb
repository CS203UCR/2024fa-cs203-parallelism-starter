    "_This section is the same in all the assignments.  It's repeated here for your reference._\n",
    "\n",
    "CS203 assignments are designed in a way to **learn by doing**.  This means you _must_ **do**.  WE have built these assignments as Jupyter notebooks so that the \"doing\" is as easy and seamless as possible. (Largely contributed by Steven Swanson at UCSD https://cseweb.ucr.edu/~swanson/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, what you'll do is answer questions about how a program will run and then compare what really happened to your predictions.  Engaging with this process is how you'll learn.  The questions that the assignment asks are there for several purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  To draw your attention to specific aspects of an experiment or of some results.\n",
    "2.  To push you to engage with the material more deeply by thinking about it.\n",
    "3.  To make you commit to a prediction so you can wonder why your prediction was wrong or be proud that you got it right.\n",
    "4.  To provide some practice with skills/concepts you're learning in this course.\n",
    "5.  To test your knowledge about what you've learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that there are three kinds of questions: \"Correctness\", \"Challenging\", and \"Completeness\". \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correctness**: You need to answer these questions with correct answers and supporting evidences (e.g., explainations, formula, equations) to get credits.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenging**: These questions are also graded by correctness, but they account for 20% of the grades in this assignment in total as they're more difficult or repetitive. \n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Completeness**: You need to complete all these questions to receive credits. We do not grade these questions on correctness, but you need to show significant efforts regarding your process of deriving the answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, \n",
    "- If you want to get full credits, you need to answer all **Correctness** and **Challenging** correctly, and finish all **Completeness** questions.\n",
    "- If you want to get 80% of the credits, you still need to answer all **Correctness** correctly and finish **Completeness** questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of our questions must answer based on prior experimental results. If you skip any prior cell, you may get a parsing error in questions from our autograder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the \"Completeness\" problems include a solution that will be hidden until you click the triangle below the question.  To get the most from them, try them on your own first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the \"Completeness\" questions ask you to make predictions about the outcome of an experiment and write down those predictions.  To maximize your learning, think carefully about your prediction and commit to it.  **You will never be penalized for making an incorrect prediction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to discuss questions with your classmatesm, but you must complete all questions on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have questions about any kind of question, please ask during office hours or during class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How To Succeed On the assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some simple tips that will help you do well on this assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Read/skim through the entire assignment and review the lecture/textbook. \n",
    "2.  Start early.  Getting answers on discord can take time.  So think through the questions (and your questions about them) carefully.\n",
    "    1. Go through the assignment once (several days before the deadline), do the parts that are easy/make sense\n",
    "    2. Ask questions/think about the rest\n",
    "    3. Come back and do the rest.\n",
    "3.  Start early.  The gradescope server/cluster can be busy and slow near deadlines.  **\"The gradescope server/cluster was slow the night of the deadline\"** is **not an excuse** for not getting the assignment done and it is not justification for asking for an extension.\n",
    "4.  Follow the guidelines below for asking answerable questions on discord.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may think to yourself: \"If I start early enough to account for all that, I'd have to start right after the assignment was announced!\"  Good thought!\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Cluster Will Get Slow** and our machines will get crowded and slow _before every deadline_.  This is completely predictable.  The cluster can also get crowded due to deadlines in other courses.  You need to start early so you can avoid/work around these slowdowns.  Unless there's some kind of complete outage, we will not grant extensions because the servers are crowded.\n",
    "    \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Help\n",
    "\n",
    "You might run into trouble while doing this assignment.  Here's how to get help:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Re-read the instructions and make sure you've followed them.\n",
    "2.  Try saving and reloading the notebook.\n",
    "3.  If you get a `FileNotFoundError` make sure you've run all the code cells above your current point in the assignment.\n",
    "4.  If you get a message like `render_code is not defined`, please make sure you've run all the code cells above your current point in the assignment.\n",
    "5.  If you get an exception or stack dump, check that you didn't accidentally modify the contents of one of the python cells.\n",
    "6.  If all else fails, post a question to discord or visit an office hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Posting Answerable Questions on Discord\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want useful answers on discord, you need to provide information that is specific enough for us to provide a useful answer.  Here's what we need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Which part of which assignment are you working on (use the section numbers)?\n",
    "2.  Which problem (copy and paste the _text_ of the question along with the number).\n",
    "\n",
    "If it's question about instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Try to be as specific as you can about what is confusing or what you don't understand (e.g., \"I'm not sure if I should do _X_ or _Y_.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "If it's a question about an error while running code, then we need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If you've committed anything, your github repo url.\n",
    "2.  If you've submitted a job with `cs203` you _must_ provide the job id.  With the id, we can figure out just about anything about your job.  Without it, we know nothing.\n",
    "3.  The _entire_ output you received.  There's no limit on how long an discord post can be.  Give us all the information, not just the last few lines.  We like to scroll!\n",
    "\n",
    "For all of the above **paste the text** into the discord question.  Please **do not provide screen captures**.  The course staff refuses to type in job ids found in screen shots.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

If you are curious, it's mostly written with `Pandas` and `matplotlib`. The code is all in `notebook.py`.   These cells should be un-editable.

    "### Answering Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this document, you'll see some questions (like the one below).  You can double click on them to edit them and fill in your answer.  Try not to mess up the formatting (so it's easy for us to grade), but at least make sure your answer shows up clearly.  When you are done editing, you can `shift-return` to make it pretty again.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few tips, pointers, and caveats for answering questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The answers are all in [github-flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) with some html sprinkled in.  Leave the html alone.\n",
    "2. Many answers require you to fill in a table, and many of the `|` characters will be missing.  You'll need to add them back.\n",
    "3. The HTML needs to start at the beginning of a line.  If there are spaces before a tag, it won't render properly.  If you accidentally add white space at the beginning of a line with an html tag on it, you'll need to fix it.\n",
    "4. Text answers also need to start at the beginning of a line, otherwise they will be rendered as code.\n",
    "5. Press `shift-return` or `option-return` to render the cell and make sure it looks good.\n",
    "6. There needs to be a blank line between html tags and markdown.  Otherwise, the markdown formatting will not appear correctly.\n",
    "7. Many of our questions must answer based on prior experimental results. If you skip any prior cell, you may get a parsing error in questions from our autograder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that there are three kinds of questions: \"Correctness\", \"Completeness\", and \"Challenging\". \n",
    "\n",
    "- Correctness: You need to answer these questions with correct answers and supporting evidences (e.g., explainations, formula, equations) to get credits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Challenging: These questions are also graded by correctness, but they account for 20% of the grades in this assignment in total as they're more difficult or repetitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Completeness: You need to complete all these questions to receive credits. We do not grade these questions on correctness, but you need to show significant efforts regarding your process of deriving the answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regarding Our Autograder\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we introduced the autograder on Gradescope. However, please be aware the purpose of autograder is to replace the TA and potentially give you early feedback of your assignment if you submit early. The autograder is not intended to give you a short-cut of receiving full credits in assignments. Here are some disclaimers about our autograders and tips regarding how to compose good answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Please provide **detailed** explainations and processes, not just the answer. Please consider the autograder as a real TA/professor. We want to see how you get an answer, not just the answer itself.\n",
    "2. Please use the **precise** terminology/wording as we teach/use in the class/assignment. Being precise is very important in communications and collaborative environments.  \n",
    "3. Please use the **exact** numbers from your measurements and please don't round your computation result if appropriate. For many questions that ask you to evaluate the answers using the real performance counter results, the autograder will parse some prior cells and grade your answers based on the experimental result. The autograder cannot correctly identify if you really use those results if you round your numbers from the output of the performance numbers.\n",
    "4. Please have the **right expectations** of the response from the autograder. As a normal TA/instructor, the autograder's response is not to tell you how to get a correct answer, but only provide a general feedback regarding where/what you might get wrong. If you really need personalized help or clarification regarding the concept of questions, please consider visiting an office hour or asking on discord at an appropriate timeslot.\n",
    "5. Please be aware that autograder are already **more relaxed** than the TAs/instructor. The autograder are more flexible than the TAs/instructor since we cannot have too complex heuristics in the autograder. That also means that you have to pay attention to the released solution. Getting full credits from the autograder does not mean you will get the same when the TAs/instructor grade the same question."

    "# Thread-level parallelism in modern processors\n",
    "\n",
    "ILP and MLP exist within a single core, and the degree of parallelism is limited by the number of instructions the CPU can issue per cycle. To get more parallelism, we need to use more CPUs, and for that we'll need to create threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "A thread is a flow of control through your program that runs on a processor. Every program has at least one thread, and by creating multiple threads you can spread the work of your program across many cores, hopefully improving it's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making programs fast via multi-threading is an extremely deep and complex area. We could easily spend an entire quarter studying techniques for creating, managing, and using threads, and most universities (including UCR) offer several courses on this topic (Start with Operating Systems and then take the graduate Parallel Computation course). Indeed, some people have devoted their entire careers to the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this effort is for good reason: the amount of ILP and MLP that individual cores can utilize has been roughly constant over last decade and shows no signs of improving much. Making matters worse, clock speeds are growing very slowly. That means that adding cores is the main way that computer are getting faster, but that only works if we can use threads effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, it's week 8, and we don't have time for all of that. Instead, we are going to take a whirlwind tour of how you can create threads, how to make them communicate with one another, why the underlying hardware can make that hard and/or slow, and what you can do about it.\n",

    "What's going on?  It would seem that our intuitive understanding of how our multi-threaded program should execute does not match what actually happens when it really executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This source of this mismatch is something called the processor's _consistency model_.   The consistency model determines how processors \"see\" memory operations performed by other processors.  In particular, it  determines in what order stores _appear_ to occur.  Different instruction sets come with different consistency models: x86 has one, ARM has one, etc.\n",

    "The basic problem with the code above is that the x86 consistency model allows the stores that `T0` performs to _appear_ , from `T1`'s perspective, to happen in a different order than `T0` executed them in.  In the code above, `T1` can load from `flag` and find that it's equal to 0 _and then_ read from `other_value` and find it equal to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "x86 provides some special instructions that prevent this reordering.  They are called 'fences' because they keep memory operations from moving around.

We saw this before with loop tiling:  Splitting and renesting loops can improve performance but it also increases instruction count, so some of the improved performance goes to paying for that overhead.  It the same thing here:  Taking and releasing a lock is code we didn't have to run before and that doesn't contribute to the useful work our program is doing.  There is no free lunch.\n",

    "\n",
    "So far, in this class we've talked about Amdahl's Law as it applies optimizations:  The more widely applicable an optimization, the larger it's benefit.  Originally, however, Amdahl's Law was just about parallel computation.  In particular, if we have $p$ processors, Amdahl's Law bounds the maximum speedup, $S$, we can achieve:\n",
    "$$S \\leq \\frac{1}{x/p + (1-x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $x$ is the fraction of the program that can parallelized across all $p$ processors.  For the histogram example, $x = 1$, so $S \\leq p$, and our implementation achieved this upper bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, however, $x < 1$, so $S < p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this, let's parallelize merge sort.  The implementation below divides the array in half and recursively calls merge sort on each sub array.  To parallelize it, we will spawn a thread to sort each sub-array.  As the sub arrays get smaller and smaller, two things will happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  We will spawn an enormous number of threads.\n",
    "2.  Each of them will do very little work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neither of these is good, so we'll use `threshold` to control the minimum size for which we will spawn a thread.  If the sub-array is smaller than `threshold`, we'll just do all the work in the current thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if the array is of size `threshold` $ \\times 2^k$, we'll use a maximum of $2^k$ threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that there are no locks.  This is because there's not actually any sharing:  Only one thread is ever working on any one part of the array at a time.  (The attentive reader will recall that I said that sharing is necessary to coordinate threads.  Here, the sharing and coordination happen before the threads are created and after we `join()` them). "
